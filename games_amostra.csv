270270,Frozen State,Aug 5, 2016,20000 - 50000,0,0,1199,0,The entire world is embraced by the man-made ice age meant to protect the human race from alien hybrids. The last survivors have formed the Resistance. On the way to the Resistance, the main character gets stranded in the closed experimental city Duga-40, where he has to survive and repair his transport to continue the journey. The game’s world is vast (65 different locations) and populated with the human survivors, military groups and pestilent alien hybrids. The world and loot are randomly generated every playthrough. There is a deep crafting system that allows you not only to cook food and make different weapons, but also to build traps, barricades and shelters. Accomplishing the main goal, which is to repair the transport and not die by the hybrid’s claws, you will discover the story of the city, meet the survivors and understand what really happened. Key Features: Rogue-like and normal modes Three main characters Diverse enemies Large open world Dynamic weather conditions Procedurally generated building interiors, loot and enemies Stealth Crafting and building Transport Basic needs (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc) NPCs and Quests,['English', 'Russian'],['English', 'Russian'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/header.jpg?t=1605700051,http://floxstudios.com/games/frozen-state.html,http://floxstudios.com,info@floxstudios.com,VERDADEIRO,VERDADEIRO,VERDADEIRO,0,,0,345,190,,26,502,,676,0,676,0,Flox Studios,Flox Studios,Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Action,Indie,RPG,Survival,RPG,Horror,Zombies,Crafting,Top-Down,Action,Open World Survival Craft,Survival Horror,Open World,Exploration,Indie,Isometric,Resource Management,Sandbox,Stealth,Singleplayer,Inventory Management,Adventure,Post-apocalyptic,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_5057eca8ddb29963a6d68929653e98c5e494b22b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_07524ca3febe530cb128815ed81ade0529f060f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_2642cfffccee144e50b0df2933d754de5e1e22e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_43d8564c743b344d6914234e7fee36527759bdab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_d28a6dab7e9000964eb3d808e66f501a08798149.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_c323772618d86fc0fefa482cf27300b03761d516.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_65235be1aceaa5d03d90f3557875c81e80976409.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_b34e4c0162dc0bad884304e68f42e8ad6e0df34c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_e3452b57cb691c910b280a4546dd28c740761a39.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_386ee9485a535477c95424066175ffd5742c461e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_34d9f34913b36ea97ef1d56b372d53151ac6a400.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_5ca34f45ccc26beec80d52f7a39043b63b23a811.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_277f6860ae8717004fc1012a114eaf755ae41c97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_e4c8102f48a9d99b4747df0882426c077584725a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_65804646ba552beb8fadf582df6a57dfb10cbc15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_7e00555dfefd21bff42d7eac846e3a6c49dc1647.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_96ba0ff14eeb6a01e884b1be6aca5ac9eb86f9c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_eb06ecb6ce158e8ae69a89d1c5e5041eb01c2960.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_90cb08ccb8ae731a2c05ff438d3bf6e7a832e2b7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_76518f9dccb909564ce1376e36ac2e0790eef5a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_406a51cb1fb8648e4d7d5e8ff879406689c2c055.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_99d399d51cf3f5622e435a431b394724d49bcc92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270270/ss_203305b50d8a515953b6cfaa938d509fb442aa01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605700051,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256666051/movie_max.mp4?t=1466697573,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256666096/movie_max.mp4?t=1466758556,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2033791/movie_max.mp4?t=1447363015,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256676419/movie_max.mp4?t=1481733710

1530070,#Snake2 DX: Reawakening,Feb 28, 2021,0 - 20000,0,0,199,0,#Snake2 DX: Reawakening is a fan-made sequel to the classic arcade game, 'Snake.' It aims to fulfill the huge potential of the first game, while remaining true to its core mechanics (just like what 'Pac Man 2: The New Adventures' did for Pac-Man)! As you would expect, #Snake2 is an explosive, balls-to-the-wall bullet hell shooter with novel shooting mechanics. It was originally prototyped in the 2012 Global Game Jam, when its insanity earned it a Kotaku feature. Bullet hell insanity #Snake2 merges unorthodox, technical, soul-crushing bullet hell difficulty with that classic 'Snake' tail-growing family fun we all know and love. Careening through the city at high speed, you will need to grow Snake and maneuver his tail-hand into grabbing machine guns and punching helicopters. All this culminates in a tense showdown with Snake's father, the all-powerful Butt King . Combine this with a high-octane, bass-heavy Buttstep soundtrack by Virt (Jake Kaufman) and you get the frenzied, chaotic adrenaline rush fever dream that Snake was always meant to be. Modes Normal mode is a mode any average person could beat. If you can't, what's wrong with you? Savage mode leaves even genre veterans bleary-eyed and shell shocked. Failass mode helps even total scrubs feel like they accomplished something. So easy, a baby could do it. Classic mode brings back that classic Snake fun of having your own tail hurt you. Retro mode lets you play the original Snake game at the same time, for double the fun! PARENTAL ADVISORY Crude humor, cartoon blood, partial nudity.

1347240,Suez Canal Simulator,2021-04-20,0 - 20000,0,0,1999,3,Take control of the Suez Canal! Pilot a ship from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and back. Take part in prototypical northbound or southbound convoys. Travel thru Egypt and feel the wind in your hair and the sand in your eyes. A full 1:1 scale re-creation of the 193-kilometer-long waterway that changed the world, the Suez Canal! A LITTLE HISTORY The history of the Suez Canal predates Cleopatra with a manmade waterway linking the ancient cities surrounding Cairo with the Red Sea. Built under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the Suez Canal opened for passage in 1869 and instantly revolutionized global travel and commerce. The canal was operated by the British and the French until 1956 when it was nationalized by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Suez Crisis of 1956 was an ill-fated attempt by the British, French, and Israelis to seize control of the canal. The Six Days War found a fleet of 15 ships stranded in the canal from 1967 until 1975, nicknamed the 'Yellow Fleet' from their decks always being covered with blowing sand. The 1973 Yom Kippur War littered the banks of the canal with the remnants of war, much of which is still visible today. WHAT TO EXPECT Simulating a journey thru the Suez Canal allows you to gain an understanding of what to expect on the real journey. After a journey through Suez Canal Simulator you will be graced with the knowledge a seasoned mariner would need in order to approach such a journey with confidence. If you plan on taking a trip through the Suez Canal then this simulator can accurately teach you the canal waterways, the sea approaches, anchorage and port locations, and the locations of lighthouses, range lights, buoys, and signal stations. Drive massive container ships, Suezmax supertankers, and modern cruise ships, and sail thru the canal on the winds of Egypt's fertile plain and the Sinai Peninsula. Meet ships along the way and take care to avoid collisions in the canal. Watch for traffic and signals in the canal or watch the sun rise and set over the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. With buttery-smooth physics, rich vivid graphics, and ultra-realistic atmosphere and lighting, Suez Canal Simulator will set the standard for PC simulator games for years to come.

745850,KARAKARA2,2017-11-10,20000 - 50000,0,0,999,1,Let us live on this land so arid. KARAKARA. It is the sound of aridity. It is the sound of dry asphalt and sandy winds. It is the sound of relentless sunshine, as well as the sound of a withering race. The 'Age of Dusk.' It is a time of senescence for the human species, during which hybrids known as the 'Others'—those who are human, yet not—exist in great numbers. On the windswept barrens of a land without moisture, a small gathering of people make their living in a world they no longer know. Down a stretch of highway and far from the heart of the town are two such people who run a small diner. To them, the circumstances that reshaped their world is of far less concern than the number of lunch boxes they can load into their delivery vehicle. After all, leaving customers hungry is not good for business, and business keeps them fed. Day after day, they occupy themselves with the endless work of their store. However, the comfortable monotony of their daily lives is turned on its head when they discover a large suitcase by the roadside on their way home from deliveries. Lying on the suitcase, unmoving, is a young girl with pink hair... Though parched, they keep each other company, and while hollow, they fill each other's voids. So shall they live on this land so arid. Features: Continuing the story from KARAKARA Meet Rebecca=Valentine, One day, she visits Leon's diner. With a gentle, tender personality and the disposition of an older sister, she handles any and all household chores flawlessly, and has excellent skills in horticulture -- rare in this 'Age of Dusk'. But the truth is, she is under certain 'circumstances'... Meet Mari=Mizuno, Holding ninjas in great esteem, this girl trains day and night. Leon finds her on the brink of starvation and comes to her aid, leading her to respect him greatly. She never slacks on her training, leading her to possess great physical prowess -- she makes full use of this, volunteering to guard the diner.,['English', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese'],['Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/header.jpg?t=1580429781,http://calmeworld.com/krkr/,https://sekaiproject.com/contact/,,VERDADEIRO,FALSO,FALSO,0,,0,557,33,,0,479,,427,0,749,0,calme,Sekai Project,Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Casual,Indie,Sexual Content,Visual Novel,Nudity,Casual,Anime,Indie,Cute,Short,Post-apocalyptic,Mystery,Mature,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_25e8e0a2d25d5cefbe53695c66a18116dd2d5b18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_d49761d15622f99679b7dd9c203fd3bd484f6830.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_a2e1a68673e66a95ad6f98a7bd85bd88204937b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_60223aaa9ecdb319855242b031f283d04aa1e04e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_95b859575f87d4033f522e02e6b5f5cbb916319d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_42b84ec0e87a929d42a8cb6084e03a674c159e0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_a99661c61d711aa7292e82c65b787caa9f2bb81d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/745850/ss_b1bcf304738fa13458d8a6748f78aed5fb5b3744.1920x1080.jpg?t=1580429781,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256700227/movie_max.mp4?t=1510351193,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256700786/movie_max.mp4?t=1510351203

It's called that because it's based on Joysticks used in arcades. 3D Joys allow the player to go 6 different directions instead of 4 directions like from a regular Joystick with the help of VR controllers. The player can summon their 3d Joystick at the position of their hand by using the grip button and choosing from up, down, right, left, forward or backwards. Testing their hand eye coordination. VR Memory Cube is the first addition to 3D Joys. Test your memory and maybe possibly improve it with a color remembering game like the classic Simon game. Basically, the game is to remember a sequence of colors on a cube while each side of the cube will light up different colors that will resemble your 3D Joystick. Online Leaderboard has been implemented for the people that want to show off. Offline Leaderboard is also an option. Oculus Rift is the only VR headset I tested this game on. The future of 3D Joys will depend on its growth because there is only one person working on this project which is myself and I am a college dropout student with a Digital Arts Media Certificate. I started working on this project when I had my first Computer Programing class, where I learned Python and which made me pursue other programming languages like C#. Unity is the engine that I am using to make this game. I am not a professional. I try as hard as I can to bring my vision for this game into fruition and it may take longer than someone that knows what they're doing but I hope you see the potential and come along the ride that is 3D Joys. @WhoDisz,['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/header.jpg?t=1658754088,http://www.3djoys.com,,3djoys@gmail.com,VERDADEIRO,FALSO,FALSO,0,,0,0,0,,9,0,,0,0,0,0,3D Joys,3D Joys,Single-player,Casual,Indie,Strategy,Early Access,,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/ss_a028693ffd9419aa6d097faee685490276eac6a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658754088,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/ss_336b55f715dfb9b37ad6e353cab4b15f4bf308c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658754088,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/ss_14cac3ce24d29532bd6a8c3c3e6804847e40d106.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658754088,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/ss_071470dd8dc71def3277df207a2e7e6fdbbb4eba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658754088,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2025280/ss_63ffaf6f5c2a6d519fe275551ecda80e30ae0f67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658754088,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256889663/movie_max.mp4?t=1654983381

1148620,Plunder,2019-09-19,0 - 20000,0,0,499,0,"Adventure Awaits! Set sail on the seas of Plunder, a massive open world packed with frightening beasts, quirky quests, dreadful pirates, and the dominating force of the British Military that you may either choose to join or destroy. With a straight-forward reputation system and action-based decision making, you will decide your fate as a Pirate Legend through quests, battles, and exploration. Endless Options! Become your own kind of captain. Will you live as a hulking, armor-covered brute cutting down everyone in your way? A cloaked pirate wizard bringing lightning storms down onto enemy ships? A quick sharpshooter taking out enemies from afar before they even get the chance to see you? Or even a modest fisherman who yearns to see new lands but wishes to stay neutral in the faces of conflict? The quick-to-learn RPG system of Plunder will let you decide. Explore! Explore seemingly endless amounts of diverse, handcrafted environments. You will adventure through tropical islands, deep caverns, snowy cliffs, grassy forests, deadly swamps, dark dungeons, and much more. Be warned, however, that deadly creatures may reside in these areas and want nothing more than to tear you limb from limb. They are most common in the dungeons beneath the surface, which are fraught with puzzles, traps, but, most importantly, treasure! Sail to over 10 towns ranging from modest fishing villages to large bustling cities, each with unique personalities, quests, and allegiances (that you may change). Raid them, liberate them, protect them, or even build one from the ground up, the choice is yours. Man the Cannons! Engage in real-time naval combat against ships of varying sizes. Fire your port and starboard cannons, or ram their broadside if you're feeling extra aggressive. Board their vessel, kill their crew, and rob them for all they're worth! Use the fast and maneuverable Sloop, the sturdy and balanced Brigantine, or the cannon-heavy Galleon! A Legendary Tale! So what say ye? Will you fight with the law and rid the world of pirate savagery or will you bask in it and reap the rewards? A tale is ready to be told, dear captain, but it is your job to tell it.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/header.jpg?t=1568959335,,,ibgamesdeveloper@gmail.com,VERDADEIRO,FALSO,FALSO,0,,0,10,0,,21,0,,0,0,0,0,IB Games,IB Games,Single-player,Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG,Action,Indie,Adventure,RPG,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_bad6b591604e927a0787916ed91ad5b1475b188b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_620b39f5750f86e4b4c2904df501efea1b641196.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_21b300981e901fcb3d8ff545af091578fc5b8e8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_ece8da9d1ff1fde8a578b63f65a13333a7b33afb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_6d3603242d7c05ee399c5fbff4bb52b38ee1617e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_3e83afd4c7c4c60ef02e8ad7563ac85e9820ec80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_a9d482dcfdc880ebc15f38e0ae02ce1b1896b80c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_4c247baadef63c332d86048834f832988cf5843c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_d7da6eeea6387a991cdc062151377ca3887f54b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148620/ss_59371ea3b88ea58e424f05c6288b731bc7b4070f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568959335,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760018/movie_max.mp4?t=1567207024
